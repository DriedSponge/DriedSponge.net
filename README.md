## About

This is the source code for my portfolio https://jordantucker.dev. You might be here just to take a look. If you really want to contribute you can, just make a pull request.

This site uses the SvelteKit and TailwindCSS for the front end, and the content is powered
by a self-hosted Strapi API. You can view the API repository here: https://github.com/driedsponge/jordan-api.

Right now this website is hosted using Cloudflare pages because I just found out it supports SSR with SvelteKit.
Hopefully it's fast. If the functions start running over 10ms I might have to switch back to self-hosting.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you find any security issues please let me know or create an issue.

You might find API keys, tokens, database details, webhook urls, etc., in older commits. I can assure you none of them work (if they did this repo would not be public).
