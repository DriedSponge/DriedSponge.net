## About

This is the source code for my website [DriedSponge.net](https://driedsponge.net). You might be here just to take a look. If you really want to contribute you can, just make a pull request.

In case you could not tell, this site uses the SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.
## Security Vulnerabilities
If you find any security issues please let me know or create an issue .

You might find API keys, tokens, database details, webhook urls, etc, in older commits. I can assure you none of them work (if they did this repo would not be public).
