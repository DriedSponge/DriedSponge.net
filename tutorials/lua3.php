                    <p class="paragraph">Welcome to my third lua tutorial! In this tutorial we will be covering the following:</p>
                    <ul class="paragraph">
                            <li><a href="#h">Hooks</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#i">if then statements</a></li>

                        </ul>
                    <h4 class="subheading">Video:</h4>  
                    <p class="pragraph">Not avaliable</p>              
                        <br>


                    <h4 class="subheading" id="h">Hooks</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">OK, the first thing you need to know about hooks is that they are epic! They allow you to run a function when something else happens. In this tutorial, I'm gonna be using the <a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/PlayerSay" target="_blank">PlayerSay</a> hook.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">First we need to set up the hook, so go back and open up the server.lua file we created in <a href="lua.php?page=2#as">tutorial 2</a>. We want to put this hook in the server file because acording to the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/">wiki</a>, it's a server side hook (<i>which means it only works server side</i>).</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">To add the hook, you need to use the <a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/hook/Add">hook.Add</a> function. This is how you would add it into your code:</p>
                        <img src="https://i.driedsponge.net/images/png/I3VFD.png" alt="hook.add example"/>
                        <p class="paragraph">Now you have your hook. Any function you put inside the hook will be ran when the player says something in chat because the hook is <a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/PlayerSay" target="_blank">PlayerSay</a>. In the hook function, ply is the entity that chatted, text is what they said, and team is whether they said it in team chat or not. Remember: The functions you put in the hook have to be server side because the hook is server side. The client side version of this hook is <a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/GM/OnPlayerChat" target="_blank">OnPlayerChat</a>. You would use the client side hoook if you wanted to have a menu open when the player said a specific command, for example, !menu.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Ok now lets make this hook do something. I want it to log the players SteamID64 and what they said to the server console so I'm gonna add my print function.</p>
                        <img src="https://i.driedsponge.net/images/png/AluHb.png" alt="hook with print example"/>
                        <p class="paragraph">Here is what every thing does:</p>
                        <ul class="paragraph">
                            <li><code>ply:Get:<a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Player/SteamID64" target="_blank">SteamID64()</a></code> will return the SteamID64 of the entity, in this case its the player that chatted. If the entity is a bot it will return nil.</li>
                            <li><code>text</code> is the string of whatever the player said.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">To test your code, start your game and say something in chat. It should return the following:</p>
                        <img src="https://i.driedsponge.net/images/png/TRWBN.png" alt="hook return" />
                        <p class="paragraph">Hooks can be very useful when trying to create a variety of things. We're now gonna make are hook more complex by adding if then statements. In the future, I will talk about more advanced hooks and creating your own hooks!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="subheading" id="i">if then statements</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">If then statements, or custom checks, allow you to trigger a function based on weather a boolean is true or false. If the boolean is true, then it will trigger the function that comes after then. If the boolean is false, then it will do nothing, or you can set up an else statement that determines what if/then does if the given value is false.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">There are multiple operators you can use in if then statement:</p>
                        <ul class="paragraph">
                            <li><code>==</code> - This is equal to. For example: <code>poo == poo</code>. This would return true because poo does equal poo!</li>
                            <li><code>~=</code> - This is not equal to. For example: <code>poo ~= poo</code>. This would return false because poo is equal to poo. If it was <code>poo ~= pee</code> then it would be true because poo is in fact not equal to pee.</li>
                            <li><code>&gt;</code> - This is greather than. If you took any basic math class in the course of your life you should know what this means. The syntax is <code>12 &gt; 11</code>. This would return true because 12 is greater than 11.</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;</code> - This is less than. The syntax is <code>11 &lt; 12</code>. This would return true because 11 is less than 12.</li>
                            <li>There is also <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>. I'm going to assumme you know what these mean because it's pretty self explanatory.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">Also keep this quote in mind when using these operators.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph"><cite>
                            When comparing values with different types, you must be careful: Remember that "0"==0 is false. Moreover, 2&lt;15 is obviously true, but "2"&lt;"15" is false (alphabetical order!). To avoid inconsistent results, Lua raises an error when you mix strings and numbers in an order comparison, such as 2&lt;"15".
                            <br>
                            - <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/3.2.html" target="_blank">lua.org 3.2 â€“ Relational Operators</a>
                            </cite></p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Alright now lets talk about actually forming our if then statement. I want to check to see if the player said Hello. It should look like this.</p>
                            <img src="https://i.driedsponge.net/images/png/MSAwv.png" alt="if then statement" />
                            <p class="paragraph">Alright, now enter your game and say something in chat. It should return the following values:</p>
                            <img src="https://i.driedsponge.net/images/png/6IAGz.png" alt="if then statement RETURN" />
                            <p class="paragraph">Now, I want to punish the player for saying hello, so I will change <code><a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Global/print" target="_blank">print</a>("Server: "..ply:<a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Player/SteamID64" target="_blank">SteamID64()</a>.." said "..text)</code> to <code>ply:<a href="https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Player/Kill" target="_blank">Kill()</a></code>. This will tell the server to kill me or any other user when they send "hello" in chat.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">You should notice noe that if you say hello in chat, you will die, and if you say something else it will print "The player did not say hi" to the server console.</p>
                            <br>
